* Initial Version

29/10/13 1.1
* The only thing changed code-wise was fixing r.close() in remotecc (Conection:request()) to actually close the connection, this most likely clogged up the net and caused slowness [and not the php caching]
* Added documentation for PHP
* Better commeneted example.lua
