* Fixed losing array elements with array_merge (PHP) by using array_merge_recursive_distinct instead. This is a fix for: {hello={hi=2,hello=1}} + {hello={hi=4}} = {hello={hi=4}}
* Update License files
* Included json module into the same file

29/10/13 1.1
* The only thing changed code-wise was fixing r.close() in remotecc (Conection:request()) to actually close the connection, this most likely clogged up the net and caused slowness [and not the php caching]
* Added documentation for PHP
* Better commeneted example.lua
